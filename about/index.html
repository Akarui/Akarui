		<h2>Raylyn Pettigrew</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Raylyn Pettigrew, and I love programming, learning languages, and taking care of animals. 
			For the past four years Iâ€™ve been studying at the University of Wyoming, and I finally have my B.S. 
			Degree in Computer Science! Throughout my academic career, I have examined various subsets in technology
			like computer security, blockchain, and computer graphics. I am continuing my education by experimenting 
			with website design, networking and databases. I am currently looking for work where I can apply my 
			current skills and learn new approaches to solving the world's problems.
