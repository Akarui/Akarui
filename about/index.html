	<p>A group of us are working with Dr. Amy Banic to research how
	virtual reality could be used as a teaching tool. Particularily,
	we are focusing our research on testing whether using a three-
	dimensional model of the human brain could help neuroanatomy 
	students to have a deeper knowledge of the different areas
	of the brain using a realistic virtual model.<p>
