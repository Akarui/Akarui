		<h2>Raylyn Pettigrew</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Raylyn Pettigrew, and I love programming, videogames, learning languages, and taking care 
			of animals. Over the past year, I've been working as a software developer at Auto-Owners Insurance.
			I completed training in Java, SQL/relational databases, J2EE, and version control through git.
			I graduated with my B.S. Degree in Computer Science where I examined various subsets in technology
			like computer security, blockchain, and computer graphics. I love learning new technology capabilities,
			and I am always ready to apply my skills to new and exciting projects.

	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>
		For the past ten years, I have been an avid video game fan. I love the artistry behind games, and I love 
		seeing new rendering techniques in action. I also enjoy playing tennis, going hiking, and swimming. 
		However, outdoor activities during the harsh winters in Michigan can sometimes be unachievable. I also 
		enjoy staying inside on the colder days and knitting, playing board games or drinking hot chocolate with 
		friends. Even though I have some favorite activities, I love to try new things. Some day, I would love
		to travel around the world, and experience new cultures.

	<h3>Career</h3> 
	<p>
		For the past year, I have been working at Auto-Owners Insurance. I began working on a 6-month contract. 
		After my contract completed in June of 2020, I began working full-time. Before I began professional work, 
		I graduated from the University of Wyoming with a Bachelor's degree in computer sceince. I mainly studied 
		backend C++ with some classes in computer graphics. In my time at the University, I learned C++, Java, 
		Haskell, and OCaml from classes. I particularly enjoyed the blockchain class I took where I taught myself 
		Solidity for for Ethereum. Now that I am finished with school, I want to continue to learn languages and 
		create useful applications. My current goal is to explore new technologies and solve complex problems 
		through code.
