This week we held a meeting discussing specifc implementation details about our project, including what modeling information we might use and our goals for the rest of the semester. This meeting was about 2 hours long and described our methods thoroughly. During the week, I also spent 2 hours working with Unity to create custom models and uploading .obj files, setting up for the next phase of our implementation. I also worked on publicity for our project and our school for 3 hours. For the next week, we will be working on setting up placeholder objects for modeling so we can replace our simple designs with the actual objects we are going to be using for the finished product.
