The unadjusted incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of people with a given complication by the person years of follow up for the given complication within each category of updated mean haemoglobin A1c concentration and reported as events per 1000 years of follow up.29 The categories were defined (median values in parentheses) as: <6% (5.6%), 6-<7% (6.5%), 7-<8% (7.5%), 8-<9% (8.4%), 9-<10% (9.4%), and ≥10% (10.6%) over the range of updated mean haemoglobin A1c of 4.6-11.2% (1st-99th centile). Follow up time was calculated from the end of the initial period of dietary treatment to the first occurrence of that complication or loss to follow up, death from another cause, or to the end of the study on 30 September 1997 for those who did not have that complication. Hence, follow up time is equivalent to duration of diabetes. For myocardial infarction and stroke for participants who had a non-fatal followed by a fatal event, the time to the first event was used. The rates were therefore for single and not recurrent events. The median follow up time for all cause mortality was 10.4 years.

We calculated adjusted incidence rates for each category of updated mean haemoglobin A1c using a Poisson regression model adjusted for male sex, white ethnic group, age at diagnosis 50–54 years, and duration of diabetes 7.5-12.5 years and expressed in events per 1000 person years of follow up. These parameters were chosen to reflect the median age and duration of diabetes and the modal ethnic group and sex.
