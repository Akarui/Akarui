What did you do last week?
For the past week, I worked some more on the Unity tutorials, and Rajiv showed me his work with the HoloLens. I also worked a bit on scheduling, and have a set schedule for lab times.

What problems/questions?
I seem to be understanding the Unity tutorials. But I would like to set up another time with Rajiv to talk about his project more in depth and look into the code to help generate more questions. 

How many hours worked?
This past week I worked for 6 hours. 
                1 hour: Meeting
                2 hours: Scheduling and journaling
                3 hours: Unity tutorials

Goals for next week?
This next week will be fairly busy for me until Wednesday since I have an OS exam and lab work for the class to do; however, I will be going to the lab during my listed hours. And I will be getting familiar with Rajiv’s code and try making modifications to it while I’m in the lab. Outside of the lab, I will be working on finding related works papers, and trying out some additional projects in Unity.
