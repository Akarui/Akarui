This past week I read more articles on AR in education, and I found a paper that used AR to show a model of the brain using CT scans, which was very cool to read about. I did this to prep for our upcoming meeting about project planning, and the steps we will be taking beyond our design stages.

This next week, I will be working on code to build on Rajiv's Vuforia project and working with Moriah to make changes so we can get more familiar with the code. Our group will also be going to RMWIC this Thursday through Friday, so we will be holding our design meeting at this conference probably Thursday evening. We will be discussing our initial coding steps, and our overall major goals for the project.
