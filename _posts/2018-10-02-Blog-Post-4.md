What did you do last week?
I read this paper on AR in education: https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/v40/v40n2/pdf/antonioli.pdf
And then I also worked with Rajiv and Dr. Banic on a poster for the Rocky Mountain Celebration of Women in Computing.
Also, Moriah and I got to work briefly with Rajiv to get a demo of how to set up Vuforia and Unity to work with the HoloLens.

What problems/questions?
None currently.

How many hours worked?
This past week I worked for 6 hours. 
30 min: Rajivâ€™s demo
1 hour: Meeting
              2 hours: Abstract
              2 hours: Research Papers

Goals for next week?
This next week I will be working on creating a AR cube using the steps that Rajiv gave us for starting a project. This will give me an idea of where we need to go next once I have a better idea of what all needs to go into this initial setup.
