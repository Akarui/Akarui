For this past week, I have been working on the Unity tutorials, and I seem to not be having trouble with them. I have been focusing on more of the general tutorials now, working through the first couple in each link. I also read through the paper that Dr. Minear sent to us about neuro imaging, and it gives me some ideas for what we may want to add on if we get time, like descriptions of each piece, and potentially a way to ‘quiz’ yourself on which piece corresponds to certain parts of the brain. For this next week I am hoping to continue working on the Unity tutorials focusing and looking at the Vuforia and Metavision links that Rajiv sent too, and maybe start thinking about ways to break down the project into some distinct portions.
