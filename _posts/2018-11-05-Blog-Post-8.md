This last week, I attended the Rocky Mountain Celebration of Women in Computing conference. At this conference, I was able to learn more about working in group projects, and I was able to give some AR demos while at the career fair. This helped me to learn the our process better for our AR project, and I feel more comfortable being able to work in this environment. At the conference, I worked 4 hours total with the demo, and I read papers for another 2 hours outside of that.
