For now, let me know that you received this email but please let me know when you have completed the following tasks:  Letter of Agreement, Tax Documentation & W-9, Direct Deposit (optional), Website URL, and CREU Pre-Survey. 

I have CC'ed Allyson Anderson on this email if you need help setting up a website directory to host your blog/web page for the project.
