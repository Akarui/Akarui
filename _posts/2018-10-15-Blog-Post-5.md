### What did you do last week?
Last week I mostly worked on projects for my classes but I found some papers that I will be reading after Wednesday of this week.

### What problems/questions?
How will we be using the prop to display the information? Will we be putting it on a 3D brain model already built, or will we be displaying it when a student looks at a piece of paper?
 
### How many hours worked?
This past week I worked for 2 hours. 
* 1 hour: Meeting
* 1 hour: Research papers

### Goals for next week?
I will be reading through the papers that I found and getting an idea for how to work with complex 3D objects with Vuforia.
