## What did you do last week?
Last week I worked mostly on exams and projects, but I was also able to read the three papers I had found last week:

* https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6180909
-Augmented body modelling teaching students using magic mirror

* https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5336476
-Augmented reality ultrasound scan practice for students 

* https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8079771
-An augmented reality tool studied with teaching secondary and higher secondary level
 
## What problems/questions?
None at the moment, but I am sure I will have more later.

## How many hours worked?
This past week I worked for 2 hours. 
                1 hour: Meeting
                3 hours: Papers
 
## Goals for next week?
This next week I will be working on organizing my documentation for the project so it can all be in a centralized location. I will also finally be able to work more on the Vuforia tutorial. And my goal is to also get at least 3 more papers read by the end of the week.
